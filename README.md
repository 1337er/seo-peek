# SEO Peek
A browser extension for Chrome &amp; Safari

Get a quick peek into on-page SEO factors of the page you visit in the browser. No need to inspect the HTML of the page. Just one click to see the availability and values of the most relevant content elements and robot directives.

## Usage
The extension gives you insight into several relevant content elements and robot directives.

### Content elements
* Page title
* Meta description
* Meta keywords
* Meta news keywords
* H1 headings


### Robot directives
* HTTP status
* Meta robots (Meta robots tag, X-Robots-Tag header)
* Canonicalization annotations (Canonical link tag, Canonical link header)
* Pagination annotations (Prev link tag, Next link tag)
* Mobile annotations (Rel-alternate-media annotation, Vary HTTP header)
* International annotations (Rel-alternate-hreflang annotation)

### Link elements
For all link elements the extension checks if the URL of a link element refers to the URL of the page (self-referential).

### Settings
Enable meta news keywords, pagination, mobile and international annotations inside the settings of the extension.
